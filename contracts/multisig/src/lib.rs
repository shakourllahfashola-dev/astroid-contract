//! # Astroid MultiSig Contract
//!
//! Prevents unilateral spending by requiring an approval **weight** threshold
//! before an action executes (PRD Doc 7 §MultiSig). Each signer is assigned a
//! positive voting weight and the contract tracks the accumulated weight of
//! approvals against a configurable `threshold` (expressed in weight units,
//! not raw signer count). This lets organizations give different administrative
//! keys or partner entities proportionally larger influence.
//!
//! The contract owns a dynamic weighted signer set and a threshold, and manages
//! internal proposals through an approve → execute flow with an optional
//! per-proposal time lock and a global emergency lock.
//!
//! Every approval weight is accumulated with checked arithmetic and every
//! quorum decision is taken through a single threshold verification helper, so
//! neither an overflowing weight sum nor a duplicate approval can manufacture
//! a quorum; signer lookups reuse the already-loaded signer set instead of
//! re-reading storage.
//!
//! [`MultiSigContract::execute_batch`] additionally supports bundling multiple
//! discrete contract calls into one transaction: each contributing signer's
//! signature is verified (by the Soroban host) over the exact batch payload
//! `(nonce, calls)`, the aggregate signature weight must meet the threshold, and
//! the nonce makes batches replay-proof. Execution is atomic — if any sub-call
//! fails the whole batch reverts with [`Error::BatchCallFailed`] or the callee's
//! error.
//!
//! [`MultiSigContract::verify_threshold`] exposes that same signature check on
//! its own, without executing anything: it verifies a set of signatures over an
//! exact payload, accumulates the weight of the distinct registered signers
//! behind them, and returns the total or [`Error::ThresholdNotMet`]. Duplicated
//! signatories are counted once, so a single key can never reach the threshold
//! alone however often it is listed.
//!
//! ## Timelocked governance
//!
//! Changing who can sign, how much a signer's vote is worth, or the threshold
//! itself is the most security-sensitive operation the contract exposes: a
//! single compromised key that could apply such a change instantly would own
//! the multisig. Every one of those modifications therefore goes through a
//! two-step, timelocked flow instead of taking effect immediately:
//!
//! ```text
//! propose_* → (>= timelock delay elapses) → execute_threshold_change
//!                   ↘ cancel_threshold_change (any signer, any time)
//! ```
//!
//! The pending change is stored with the `eta` computed at proposal time, so
//! shortening the delay later can never accelerate an in-flight change. A
//! matured change stays executable for [`GOVERNANCE_GRACE_PERIOD`] and then
//! expires, so stale proposals cannot lie dormant and fire much later. The
//! delay itself is governed the same way (`propose_timelock_delay_change`) and
//! is clamped to `[MIN_TIMELOCK_DELAY, MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY]`, so no single
//! signer can shrink the review window to nothing.
//!
//! Events: `signer/added`, `signer/removed`, `signer/weight`,
//! `threshold/changed`, `timelock/changed`, `govchange/proposed`,
//! `govchange/executed`, `govchange/cancelled`, `proposal/approved`,
//! `proposal/executed`, `batch/executed`, `emergency/lock`.
//!
//! Execution below the weight threshold is rejected with
//! [`Error::InsufficientWeight`]; premature governance execution with
//! [`Error::TimelockNotExpired`]; governance calls from a non-signer with
//! [`Error::UnauthorizedModification`].
